# Slave Module

Module specifcially for the slave microcontroller of the flight computer

## BMP Testing

We ran a BMP testing seeing how long it could run  without issues. It was able to run 85142 cycles with a delay of 50ms in between cycles, interpret that as you wish, by pure time it says it ran for 70 minutes. The cause of failure was it got impacted directly, so it could have probably run for even longer.
